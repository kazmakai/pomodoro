# Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals.

I wanted to build something I can use to be more productive. I have a short attention span when and I find the Pomodoro technique helps me stay focus for at least 25mins at a time.

Here is the [link of the prototype](https://kazmakai.github.io/pomodoro/).
